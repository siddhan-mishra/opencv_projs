Great question, Siddhant! 👨‍💻 Let’s walk you through downloading **MobileNet SSD** files **into your Python virtual environment** on Raspberry Pi.

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Setting Up MobileNet SSD in Your Virtual Environment

---

### 📍 1. **Activate your virtual environment**
If you already have a virtual environment set up (say, named `venv`), activate it:

```bash
source ~/path_to_your_env/venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 📍 2. **Install required Python packages**

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

> **Note:** If you're on Raspberry Pi, and this fails due to OpenCV build size, install from the apt repository:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-opencv
```

---

### 📍 3. **Create a folder for model files**
Make a folder to store the SSD model files:

```bash
mkdir -p mobilenet_ssd
cd mobilenet_ssd
```

---

### 📍 4. **Download the required files**

#### ➤ Download `MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt`
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD/master/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt
```

#### ➤ Download `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel`
```bash
wget https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD/releases/download/v1.0/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
```

> These are the two files you reference in your Python code:
```python
cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe(
    'mobilenet_ssd/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt',
    'mobilenet_ssd/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel'
)
```

---

### 📍 5. **Place the detection script next to this folder**
Your directory should look like this:

```
project_folder/
│
├── detect_objects.py
└── mobilenet_ssd/
    ├── MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt
    └── MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
```

---

### 📍 6. **Run the script**
Activate your env (if not already) and run:

```bash
python detect_objects.py
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting on Raspberry Pi:

- If RAM is tight, reduce video resolution:
  ```python
  cap.set(3, 320)
  cap.set(4, 240)
  ```
- If `cv2.dnn` isn't available, confirm installation with:
  ```bash
  python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
  ```

Need help setting up face or hand detection too in this environment? I can plug that in as well.
