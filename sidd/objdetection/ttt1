Apologies for the inconvenience, Siddhant. It appears that the previous links to the MobileNet SSD model files are no longer active. Let's proceed with an alternative approach to obtain these files.

ðŸ“¥ Step-by-Step: Downloading MobileNet SSD Model Files
1. Create a Directory for Model Files
First, create a directory to store the model files:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p mobilenet_ssd
cd mobilenet_ssd
2. Download the Model Files
Since the direct links are unavailable, we can use the wget command with alternative sources. However, if these also fail, we can manually download the files using a web browser.

a. Using wget (If Available)
bash
Copy
Edit
wget https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD/raw/master/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt
wget https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD/raw/master/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
Note: These links are based on the original repository. If they are still inaccessible, proceed to the manual download method below.

b. Manual Download
Open the following URLs in your web browser:

MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt

MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel

Click on the "Download" button or right-click on the "Raw" button and select "Save link as..." to download the files.

Move the downloaded files into the mobilenet_ssd directory you created earlier.

3. Verify the Files
Ensure that both files are present in the mobilenet_ssd directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls mobilenet_ssd
You should see:

Copy
Edit
MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel  MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt
âœ… Next Steps
With the model files in place, you can proceed to run your object detection script. Ensure that your script references the correct paths to these files:

python
Copy
Edit
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe(
    'mobilenet_ssd/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt',
    'mobilenet_ssd/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel'
)
If you encounter any further issues or need assistance with integrating face or hand detection, feel free to ask!
